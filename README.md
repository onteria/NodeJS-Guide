## Introduction

This project is meant to guide new users of node.js on how to achieve various tasks in an organized manner. Right now it requires a lot of back and forth navigation through the documentation in order to work with basic functionality. It is my hope that this project proves useful in helping you get started with node.js.

## Process

Drafts / in progress versions of the guide are developed at [the wiki](https://github.com/onteria/NodeJS-Guide/wiki). When a part of the guide becomes finalized, it will be added to the git hub repository to be available for forking and cloning by others.
